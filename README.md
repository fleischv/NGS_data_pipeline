Pipeline development task

• Take an NCBI GenBank accession as commandline parameter (--accession) and downloads the FASTA
file for that accession. The default accession (if none is given on the commandline) should be M21012

• Take a directory of genomes in FASTA format from your colleague1

•Combine all of those single FASTA files into one FASTA file2 – this is necessary for the alignment tool
used in the next step

• Run the mafft aligner on the combined FASTA file

• Clean-up the resulting aligned FASTA file using trimal, using the -automated13 operation

• Publish both the cleaned up alignment and the HTML report generated by trimal into an output directory
